# C1_method_v2


Implemented Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to parameterise the allometric diet breadth model (ADBM) using body size data and presence-absence information of trophic interactions to predict trophic interactions.

* Folder 'R' contains the R functions used.
* Folder 'inst/main' contains the scripts require to execute the above functions. For example, 'main_rejection.R' is used to implement rejection ABC to parameterise the ADBM.
* Folder 'results' contains the results, for example, visualisations generated.
